Playground for things.

Architecture
- dart_datakit
  - Data structure for future work. It needs refinement and full capabilities.

- alga_configui
  - An attachment for existing projects that allows easy input of JSON and returns JSON in a seamless way. In the future, it may accommodate different data types. This package works with both the datacat and datakitties objects.

- flutterboard
  - A one-stop UI handler that works with configui.

- Future Projects
  - Future projects will need to incorporate their own logic. flutterboard and configui provide a framework but not specialized application functionalities. For example, a geospatial data dashboard may require a new package and its implementation into new projectsâ€”e.g., geoflo is the package, while georeview is the application that uses geoflo and flutterboard.
