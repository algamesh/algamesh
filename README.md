Playground for things.

Architceture.

- dart_datakit
  - data structure for future work - needs refinement and full capacities

- alga_configui
  - attachment on existing projects to allow for easy way to apss in json and return json in a neasy way
  - in the future, maybe accomodate different data types
  - working with datacat and datakitties objects
 
- flutterboard
  - one stop ui handler that works with configui

-   future projects will need to accomodate their own logic - flutterboard and configui provides framework but not specalized app functionalities
-   ex. geospatial data dashboar will require a ne wpackage and implementations of this package into new projects - ex geoflo is package,georeview is the application using geoflo and flutterboard
